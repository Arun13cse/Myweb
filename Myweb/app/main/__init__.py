'''Blueprints are created by instantiating an object of class Blueprint .
The constructor for this class takes two required arguments:
the blueprint name and the module or package where the blueprint is located.
As with applications, Pythonâ€™s __name__ variable
is in most cases the correct value for the second argument.'''
