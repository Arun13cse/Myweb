        in the global scope, so routes can be
        easily defined using the app.route decorator.

        only after create_app() is invoked,

    '''Luckily Flask offers a better solution using blueprints.
        A blueprint is similar to an application in that it can also
        define routes. The difference is that routes associated with
        a blueprint are in a dormant state until the blueprint is
        registered with an application,at which point the routes become
        part of it. Using a blueprint defined in the global scope,
        the routes of the application can be defined in almost the
        same way as in the single-script application'''

        When used, all the routes defined in the blueprint will be
        registered with the given prefix, in this case /auth.
        For example, the /login route will be registered as /auth/login,
        and the fully qualified URL under the development web server
        then becomes http://localhost:5000/auth/login'''
